       For this lucky number game, there are 5 balls randomly drawn,
       each between 1 and 65, and one "super ball" between 1 and 30.

       In this game, the same number CAN appear more than once.

       The returned String should have the 6 numbers listed (they do not
       need to be in ascending order): 5 "lucky numbers" between 1 and 65,
       and the last one, the "super ball," between 1 and 30.
       See samples below.

       This method should call your randomIntegerBetween method above multiple times --
        don't rewrite the same code over and over to generate multiple random numbers,
        use your method!
